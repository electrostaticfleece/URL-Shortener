# URL Shortener

A url shortener made for Free Code Camp's curriculum built using Node, PostgreSQL, Express, jQuery, and Bootstrap. The design was based off of [this tutorial](https://coligo.io/create-url-shortener-with-node-express-mongo/) and substitutes PostgreSQL for MongoDB. A [working example](https://babify.herokuapp.com/) of this has been deployed to Heroku.
